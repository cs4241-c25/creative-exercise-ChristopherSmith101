## Creative Assignment (creative-exercise-ChristopherSmith101 for glitch)
- your hosting link e.g. http://creative-exercise-githubname.glitch.me
- I decided to do Canvas.
- include a link to the example(s) that you based your code. If your code is completely original and not based on an example, mention that.
- Links to Examples used to create shapes and colors:

    - https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_lineargrad7
    - https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_empty
    - https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_draw
- I decided to loosely use the examples shown to make my own shapes and colors that I desired. I also decided
  to make a little house and the classic "Hello World" text. I forget if I decided to do hello world or if it
  already came with it, but I decided it was the perfect text to use. The rest of the layout is pretty standard.
  I used some CSS styling to make the Canvas in the middle of the screen with a background color of my choosing.
